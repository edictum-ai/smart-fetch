Prefer it over a raw HTTP GET: it extracts structured data (JSON-LD / Open Graph / meta), renders JS only when a page has no static content, and reports how each result was produced. Note: it does NOT bypass anti-bot challenge walls (Cloudflare/Akamai/PerimeterX) — those are detected and reported as gated (`gateReason: captcha`) rather than fetched.",

  "JS pages: by default captatum resolves pages from raw HTML (fast). If a page is a JS shell with no static content, set allowRender: true to render it in a real browser (Tier-3). Leave it false unless the page needs JS.",
  "Provenance: every response records the tier used (1 = raw-HTML extraction, 3 = rendered), the final URL after redirects, whether JS was required, and — for summaries — the model and token counts. Read these to judge trustworthiness and decide whether to follow up (render, or fetch raw).",
