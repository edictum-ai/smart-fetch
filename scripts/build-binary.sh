# Compile the self-contained local-binary flavor of smart-fetch.
#
# The local flavor is the stdio MCP bridge (src/interfaces/mcp/stdio-bridge.ts)
# compiled into one executable with `bun build --compile`. Bun is an EXTERNAL
# tool, not an npm dependency, so this script never adds a package. It also never
# pretends to succeed: it fails loudly when Bun is missing, when the compile
# fails, or when the produced binary does not actually start (a startup self-check).
#
# Known packaging blocker on this repo's deps (see docs/architecture.md):
#   - Playwright's bundled core statically references optional `chromium-bidi`
#     paths Bun cannot resolve. Tier-3 render is a lazy/optional `import("playwright")`
#     (gated by allowRender, default false), so it is marked --external here.
#   - `wreq-js` (the Tier-1 egress primitive) loads a native `.node` prebuilt via a
#     relative require that `bun --compile` does not embed, so the binary aborts at
#     startup with "Failed to load native module". Until wreq-js native assets can
#     be embedded/shipped alongside the binary, the self-check below fails on
#     purpose and no broken artifact is left behind. The stdio bridge still runs
#     under the pinned Node 24 toolchain via `pnpm run bridge`.
